/* Ans :1) The key dofference between the flexbox and CSS 
grid layout models lies in their layout strategies and how 
they handle the arrangement of elements.

Flexbox is primarily designed for one diamensioanl layput focusig on 
distributing space and aligning items along a single axix (either horizontally or vertically)
It's best suited for layouts where you ahave a row or column of items 
such as navigation menus, card-based designs, or centering content within a container.

CSS Grid is desiged for two dimensional layouts, allowing  you to define both rows and columns. It creates a grid of cells 
where content can be placed in any cell or span across multiple cells. CSS grid is ideal for complex grid-based 
designs like magazine layouts, forms, and any layout where content needs to be placed in a precise grid Structure.

Choosing between Flex and CSS grid depends on your specific layout requirements.

You might choose Flexbox when you need to arrange items along a single axix, for example, when creating navigation bars, header/footer layuts, or aligning elements within a contaner. Flexbox
is great for responsive  designs where items can vary in size.
